----IMPLEMENTATION----
WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net u_top_vga/u_mouse_position/next_turn_nxt__0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin u_top_vga/u_mouse_position/next_turn_nxt_reg_i_2/O, cell u_top_vga/u_mouse_position/next_turn_nxt_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net u_top_vga/u_mouse_position/turn_forced__0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin u_top_vga/u_mouse_position/turn_forced_reg_i_1/O, cell u_top_vga/u_mouse_position/turn_forced_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
